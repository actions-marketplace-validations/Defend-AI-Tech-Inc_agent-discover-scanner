```

A GHOST agent is an AI system making real API calls — consuming tokens, potentially accessing sensitive data — with no corresponding source code, deployment record, or owner. No static analysis tool finds this. No SIEM alerts on it. AgentDiscover Scanner finds it in under 60 seconds by watching the runtime and cross-referencing it against your codebase simultaneously.

**Your engineering team thinks they know what AI is running. The GHOST classification is what they don't know.**

---

## What makes this different

Most security tools tell you what's in your code. AgentDiscover Scanner tells you what's **actually running** — and crucially, what's running that has **no business being there**.

```
👻 GHOST AGENT DETECTED
   Workload:    trading-bot (Deployment/default)
   Connected:   api.openai.com — LIVE
   SaaS:        openai — confirmed active connection
   Source code: None found in scanned repositories
   Owner:       Unknown — no deployment record, no code review

👻 GHOST AGENT DETECTED
   Workload:    shadow-agent (Pod/kube-system)
   Connected:   api.anthropic.com — LIVE
   SaaS:        anthropic — confirmed  |  gcp — active socket
   Blast radius: HIGH (cloud provider access confirmed)
   Source code: None found in scanned repositories
   Owner:       Unknown — no deployment record, no code review
```

Every detected agent also carries a **SaaS blast radius** — a live-observed map of which services it's actively connected to, derived from network traffic, not just configuration files:

```
crewai-agent (CONFIRMED)
  saas_connections:
    anthropic: confirmed  ← active_connection observed
    github:    medium     ← open socket
  risk_flags: [cloud_credentials_present]
  blast_radius: 70/100
```

`confirmed` means the connection was **live-observed** during the scan — not inferred from a config file.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# macOS (recommended)
brew install python@3.12 osquery pipx
pipx install agent-discover-scanner
pipx ensurepath && source ~/.zshrc   # add ~/.local/bin to PATH

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install -y python3 osquery
pip3 install agent-discover-scanner

# Linux (RHEL/Fedora)
sudo dnf install -y python3 osquery
pip3 install agent-discover-scanner

# Windows (PowerShell — elevated)
winget install Python.Python.3.12
winget install osquery.osquery
pip install agent-discover-scanner
```

> **macOS:** never use `sudo` with the installer — Homebrew refuses root and osquery silently fails.
> Use `pipx` to avoid Python environment conflicts. If `agent-discover-scanner` is not found after install, run `pipx ensurepath` and restart your terminal.

Then run your first scan:

```bash
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects --duration 30
```

To verify all layers are working before your first real scan:

```bash
agent-discover-scanner --version
osquery --version
which agent-discover-scanner   # macOS: should show ~/.local/bin/agent-discover-scanner

# Or use --dry-run to get a complete layer readiness report:
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects --dry-run
```

To upload results to the DefendAI platform:

```bash
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects \
  --platform \
  --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

---

## What you'll see on your first scan

Running `scan-all` on a real developer machine (macOS, ~30s observation window):

```
$ agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects --duration 30

For an executive-ready audit bundle (AIBOM + markdown reports):

```bash
agent-discover-scanner audit ~/projects --output ./audit-report
# Writes: audit-report/aibom.json, ghost-agents.md, mcp-report.md, summary.md
```

---

## Common issues

**`agent-discover-scanner: command not found` after pipx install**

```bash
pipx ensurepath
source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc on Linux
```

If still missing: `which agent-discover-scanner` should show `~/.local/bin/agent-discover-scanner`. If `~/.local/bin` is not in `$PATH`, add it manually.

**Layer 2 network monitoring fails on Linux**

Layer 2 requires elevated privileges on Linux. Either run with `sudo` (avoid on macOS) or skip the layer:

```bash
sudo agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects --duration 30
# or skip Layer 2:
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects --skip-layers 2
```

**osquery not installed — Layer 4 skipped**

Layer 4 is optional. If osquery is not installed, the scan continues with Layers 1–3. To install:

```bash
# macOS
brew install osquery
# Linux
sudo apt-get install osquery   # or see https://osquery.io/downloads
```

**Large repo warning — scan is slow**

If you see `⚠ Large scan path detected: N Python files`, point the scanner at a specific project directory rather than your entire home folder:

```bash
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects/my-agent-project --duration 30
```

**Layer 3 Kubernetes not available**

If no cluster is reachable, Layer 3 logs a warning and continues. GHOST detection still works via Layer 2 network correlation. To skip Layer 3 explicitly:

```bash
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects --skip-layers 3
```

**Check what layers are ready before scanning**

```bash
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects --dry-run
```

---

## How it works

![GHOST detection mechanism](./docs/ghost-detection.svg)

AgentDiscover Scanner runs four detection layers simultaneously and correlates them into a single agent inventory. Each layer sees something the others can't.

![AgentDiscover detection pipeline](./docs/architecture.svg)

### Layer 1 — Source code analysis

Static analysis of Python and JavaScript/TypeScript. Detects LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, direct OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini API usage, and any HTTP client targeting LLM endpoints. Handles import aliasing and indirect usage patterns. Generates SARIF output for CI/CD integration.

### Layer 2 — Live network monitoring

Passive observation of outbound connections to AI providers — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, Cohere, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, and vector stores. No packet capture. Identifies which process is making each connection, enabling per-agent SaaS attribution.

Real scan output:
```
[DETECT] Google AI connection from Mail (PID: 776) → generativelanguage.googleapis.com:993
[DETECT] OpenAI connection from Microsoft Edge Helper (PID: 4172) → api.openai.com:443
[DETECT] Anthropic connection from Cursor Helper (PID: 61436) → api.anthropic.com:443
[DETECT] OpenAI connection from OneDrive (PID: 96089) → api.openai.com:443
```

### Layer 3 — Kubernetes runtime

Kernel-level visibility into pod behavior via Tetragon. Identifies which workloads are actively making AI calls — including workloads with no corresponding source code. Works with any CNI. Falls back to Kubernetes API discovery if Tetragon is unavailable.

When Layer 1 (code) and Layer 3 (K8s runtime) both detect the same agent, it becomes **CONFIRMED**:

```
Detection Coverage:
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Layers        ┃ Agents ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━┩
│ layer1,layer3 │ 2      │  ← CONFIRMED: seen in code AND running in K8s
│ layer1        │ 3      │  ← UNKNOWN: code found, not yet observed at runtime
└───────────────┴────────┘
```

### Layer 3 limitations

Layer 3 (eBPF via Tetragon) is **Linux-only**. On macOS and Windows developer machines, Layer 3 is skipped automatically — the scan continues with Layers 1, 2, and 4. The K8s API monitor path works on all platforms and requires only `kubectl` with cluster read access.

### Layer 4 — Endpoint discovery

Scans developer machines, CI/CD runners, and workstations via osquery. Finds installed AI packages, desktop AI applications (ChatGPT Desktop, Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot), active connections, browser-based AI usage, and VSCode extensions.

### Cross-layer correlation

After all layers run, the correlator builds a unified agent identity. An agent seen in code (Layer 1), confirmed running in K8s (Layer 3), and observed making network calls (Layer 2) is a single correlated identity — not three separate findings.

Agents present at runtime with **no Layer 1 match** become GHOST agents.

### SaaS blast radius detection (v2.3.0+)

After correlation, each agent receives a `saas_connections` profile built from all four layers:

```json
{
  "detected":  ["anthropic", "gcp", "github"],
  "confirmed": ["anthropic"],
  "evidence": {
    "anthropic": ["active_connection", "open_socket"],
    "gcp":       ["open_socket"],
    "github":    ["vscode_extension_detected"]
  },
  "confidence": {
    "anthropic": "confirmed",
    "gcp":       "medium",
    "github":    "medium"
  },
  "has_cloud_provider": true,
  "has_llm_provider":   true
}
```

---

## High-risk agent detection (v2.4.0+)

The scanner detects autonomous agent platforms that carry systemic security risk by design — not misconfigurations, but architecture.

**OpenClaw** (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) is the primary target. It has full filesystem access, terminal execution, email and messaging integration, and runs as a persistent background daemon. CVE-2026-25253 CVSS 8.8. Gartner: "insecure by default." Microsoft: "treat as untrusted code execution."

Detection uses corroborated signals — never a single port number:

```
🚨 HIGH-RISK AGENT CONFIRMED: OpenClaw
   Autonomous agent with system-level access — filesystem,
   terminal, email, and messaging integration.
   Capabilities: filesystem, terminal, email, browser, messaging
```

---

## MCP server detection (v2.4.0+)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the integration layer between AI agents and enterprise SaaS. Supported by Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, and VS Code.

The scanner detects MCP servers across all AI clients and classifies each by publisher verification:

```
⚠ Local MCP script detected — unknown code with tool access
⚠ Unverified MCP server: filesystem (Community/Unknown) — not from a verified publisher
⚠ Unverified MCP server: mcpfw (Unknown) — not from a verified publisher

✓ Verified: @salesforce/mcp-server (Salesforce official)
```

Supported clients: Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, Continue.dev, Zed, and project-level MCP configs.

**Non-developer detection:** Financial analysts connecting ChatGPT Teams to Salesforce via UI leave no local config file. The scanner detects this via Layer 2 network traffic — the only tool that catches this pattern.

Risk prioritization in reporting (guidance):
- Unverified MCP server → HIGH
- MCP filesystem access → HIGH
- MCP + production environment → CRITICAL
- OpenClaw + GHOST → CRITICAL

---

## Daemon mode

Run continuously as a background service, updating the agent inventory every 30 seconds:

```bash
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects \
  --daemon \
  --output ~/defendai-results \
  --platform \
  --platform-interval 5    # upload to platform every ~2.5 minutes
```

> **Note:** `--daemon` runs until you press Ctrl+C. Use `--output ~/defendai-results` (or any user-writable path) — avoid `/var/log/` which requires root.
> If running as root, `~/projects` resolves to root's home directory, not yours. Always run without `sudo`.

With `--platform`, the daemon syncs to the DefendAI platform every N correlation cycles (default: every 5 cycles ≈ 2.5 minutes) and always uploads a final snapshot on shutdown.

**Linux — install as a systemd service:**

```bash
sudo bash deployment/systemd/install-service.sh ~/projects
systemctl status defendai-scanner
```

---

## Scanning an additional source repository

The `--src-repo` flag adds a second codebase to every Layer 1 scan. Findings are merged into `layer1_code.sarif` alongside the primary scan, so the correlator sees code from both locations in the same run — useful when the runtime you're monitoring is served by a separate repo (microservices, shared ML libraries, a vendor repo you don't own locally).

```bash
# One-shot: include a remote team's repo in the scan
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects \
  --src-repo https://github.com/acme/ml-services \
  --duration 30

# Local path — no clone step
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects \
  --src-repo ~/shared/ml-services
```

In one-shot mode the remote repo is shallow-cloned, scanned, and deleted before the correlator runs.

In daemon mode, pass `--src-repo-ttl` to control how frequently the additional repo is re-fetched:

```bash
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects \
  --daemon \
  --src-repo https://github.com/acme/ml-services \
  --src-repo-ttl 7200    # re-clone at most once every 2 hours
```

Auth failures (HTTP 401/403, SSH key rejection) back off exponentially up to 5 minutes and retry automatically — the primary scan continues uninterrupted.

---

## Customizing known applications

By default, the scanner classifies common desktop applications (browsers, Office 365, Cursor, Slack, Claude Desktop, etc.) as **Shadow AI** rather than GHOST when they make AI API calls.

Browser-based AI usage (claude.ai, chatgpt.com, copilot.microsoft.com) is detected via Layer 4 browser history — these are classified as Shadow AI automatically. Note that Layer 4 reads the browser's committed history database, not the current active session, so a tab open right now may not appear until the browser flushes its history.

To add your own internal tools:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.defendai
echo "my-internal-ai-tool" >> ~/.defendai/known_apps.txt
echo "company-llm-client" >> ~/.defendai/known_apps.txt
```

See `docs/known-apps-example.txt` for the full format.

When connected to the DefendAI platform (`--platform` flag), the tenant-managed list is downloaded automatically on startup and merged with your local overrides.

---

## DefendAI platform integration

The scanner is the **discovery layer**. The platform is where discovered agents become governed agents.

```bash
agent-discover-scanner scan-all ~/projects \
  --platform \
  --api-key YOUR_KEY \
  --duration 30
```

When connected to the platform, each scan triggers the **correlation engine** which builds a living identity map across every machine, every environment, and every scan:

- **Agent identity resolution** — the same CrewAI agent on a laptop, in staging K8s, and in prod K8s is recognized as one agent at different lifecycle stages
- **Behavioral drift detection** — agent added `has_code_execution=true` since last week? That's a signal. Platform tracks it.
- **Cross-machine intelligence** — agent seen on 3 machines and crossed from dev into prod? Automatic risk escalation.
- **SaaS blast radius** — platform aggregates confirmed SaaS connections across all scans and computes blast radius score.

After a few scans, the DefendAI platform report shows:

```

## CI/CD integration

### GitHub Action (recommended)

The repo ships a reusable composite action. Add it to any workflow with one step — no `pip install` required:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/agent-scan.yml
name: AI Agent Scan

on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  security-events: write   # required to upload SARIF to GitHub Security tab

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: Defend-AI-Tech-Inc/agent-discover-scanner@v2.6.0
        with:
          path: '.'               # directory to scan (default: .)
          upload-sarif: 'true'    # post findings to GitHub Security tab (default: true)
```

Findings appear in **Security → Code scanning alerts** as soon as the workflow runs.

**Inputs**

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | `.` | Directory to scan |
| `output` | `agent-scan-results.sarif` | SARIF output file path |
| `upload-sarif` | `true` | Upload to GitHub Security tab |
| `python-version` | `3.12` | Python version to use |

**Output**

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `sarif-file` | Path to the generated SARIF file |

> **Note:** `permissions: security-events: write` is required at the job or workflow level for `upload-sarif: 'true'` to work. If your repo is private and you don't have GitHub Advanced Security, set `upload-sarif: 'false'` and consume the SARIF artifact directly.

### Manual install in CI

```yaml
- name: Scan for AI agents
  run: |
    pip install agent-discover-scanner
    agent-discover-scanner scan . --format sarif --output results.sarif

- name: Upload SARIF to GitHub Security tab
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: results.sarif
```

For a full-stack scan (all layers, structured output):

```yaml
- name: Full agent scan
  run: |
    agent-discover-scanner scan-all . \
      --duration 30 \
      --output ./defendai-results \
      --skip-layers 3    # no K8s cluster in CI
```
