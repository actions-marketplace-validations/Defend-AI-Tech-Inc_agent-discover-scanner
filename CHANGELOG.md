## [Unreleased]

## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **`git-scan` subcommand** — scan git commit history for AI-related security signals without running a full multi-layer scan
  - Detects AI API keys committed to history (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, Groq) — rule `DAI-GIT-001`, severity critical
  - Finds sensitive files ever tracked in git (`.env`, model weight files, AI config files) — rule `DAI-GIT-002`, severity high
  - Reports when each AI framework was first introduced to dependency files (requirements.txt, package.json, pyproject.toml) — rule `DAI-GIT-005`, severity info
  - Exits with code 1 on critical or high findings for CI/CD gate use
  - `--since DAYS` controls secret search window (default: 90 days); sensitive file and dependency scans always cover full history
  - `--output FILE` writes findings as JSON
  - `--verbose` shows dependency introduction timeline (hidden by default)

- **`--src-repo` / `--src-repo-ttl` flags for `scan-all`** — scan a second source repository through Layer 1 and merge findings into `layer1_code.sarif`
  - Supports local paths (no clone) and remote URLs (shallow `git clone --depth=1`)
  - Useful when the runtime being monitored is served by a repo separate from the scan root (microservices, shared ML libraries)
  - In daemon mode, `--src-repo-ttl SECONDS` gates how often the repo is re-fetched (default: 3600)
  - Auth failures (HTTP 401/403, SSH rejection) back off exponentially (30s → 300s) without interrupting the primary scan

- **macOS AI presence detection** (`macos_detector.py`) — zero-privilege check runs at the start of Layer 2 on macOS
  - Checks `/Applications/` and `~/Applications/` for known AI app bundles
  - Scans running processes via psutil for AI tool process names
  - Prints detected tools (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Ollama, etc.) immediately — before the network observation window begins
  - Findings are injected into Layer 2 output and flow into the correlator as Shadow AI (live connections take priority; presence findings fill gaps)

- **Network monitor progress ticks** — prints `[Ns] Watching for AI connections... (Ns remaining)` every 15 seconds when no detection has fired, eliminating the silent wait during the observation window

- **Zero-findings guidance** — when all inventory counts are zero after a one-shot scan, prints actionable next steps pointing at likely causes and suggesting `git-scan` as an alternative

### Changed

- **Known apps list expanded** — added Windsurf, Windsurf Helper, Zed, Gemini, Perplexity, GitHub Copilot, Codeium, Ollama, Ollama Runner, LM Studio, Jan, Msty to `BUILTIN_KNOWN_APPS`; these now classify as Shadow AI rather than producing false GHOST findings

### Fixed

- macOS scans no longer produce GHOST false positives for Windsurf, Zed, Ollama, LM Studio, and Perplexity when those tools are running and making network connections

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- `scan_runner.execute_scan_all` — shared implementation for `scan-all` and `audit`
- **`audit`** command — runs full pipeline into `OUTPUT/raw/`, then writes `aibom.json`,
  `ghost-agents.md`, `mcp-report.md`, and `summary.md`
- **`aibom`** module — best-effort CycloneDX 1.6–oriented export from `agent_inventory.json`
- **`scan-all --layer`** — run a single facet: `code`, `network`, `k8s`, `endpoint`, or `mcp`
- **`agent-discover`** entry point (alias for `agent-discover-scanner`)
- **`scan --format text`** — alias for `table` (unchanged default)

### Changed
- README: accuracy fixes (commands, CI example, requirements table, MCP severity wording),
  documents `audit`, `--layer`, dual CLI names, and real `scan-all --format` behavior

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **OpenClaw detection** (`high_risk_agents.py`)
  - Multi-signal corroborated detection — no false positives
  - Definitive signals: ~/.openclaw/, ~/clawd/SOUL.md, port 18789,
    npm package, launchd/systemd daemon service
  - Supports AutoGPT and BabyAGI detection
  - Console warning fires on confirmed/high confidence only
  - Never flags based on port alone (no port 8080 used)

- **MCP server detection** (`mcp_detector.py`)
  - Detects MCP across ALL AI clients: Claude Desktop, Cursor,
    Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, VS Code Copilot
  - Verified publisher registry: Salesforce, Microsoft, Atlassian,
    GitHub, Stripe, Anthropic reference implementations
  - Distinguishes official vendor packages from community forks
  - Network-based detection catches non-developer users (financial
    analysts connecting ChatGPT Teams to Salesforce via UI —
    no local config file required)
  - Flags unverified MCP servers and local scripts
  - Merges detected MCP SaaS into sconnections blast radius

- `high_risk_agent` and `mcp_connections` fields in upload payload
- `high_risk_agent` and `mcp_connections` on AgentInventoryItem

### Changed
- Risk flags now include `high_risk_agent_detected`,
  `mcp_filesystem_access`, `mcp_code_execution`,
  `mcp_database_access`, `mcp_remote_server`

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- `known_apps.py` module with three-tier resolution for known 
  desktop application list:
  - Tier 1: Platform list via DefendAI API (when --platform enabled)
  - Tier 2: Local override file (~/.defendai/known_apps.txt)
  - Tier 3: Built-in defaults (browsers, Office, AI desktop apps)
- `docs/known-apps-example.txt` — example local override file
- `defendai-sdk` integration for platform known apps fetch
  (requires local install until SDK is on PyPI)

### Changed
- GHOST classification now distinguishes known desktop applications
  from truly ungoverned agents
- Known desktop apps (Notes, Cursor, Chrome, Edge, Slack, etc.) 
  making AI calls are classified as `shadow_ai_usage` instead of GHOST
- `shadow_ai_usage` appears as "SHADOW AI" in the inventory table
- Layer 3 (K8s) GHOST logic unchanged — workloads are always GHOST

### Fixed
- False positive GHOST classifications for known desktop applications
- Notes.app, Cursor, OneDrive, Microsoft Edge no longer appear as
  GHOST agents when making AI API calls

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- Daemon mode now uploads to platform periodically via `--platform-interval N` flag
- Upload interval defaults to every 5 correlation cycles (~2.5 minutes)
- Platform sync cadence printed on daemon start when `--platform` is set
- Upload failures in daemon mode are logged but never crash the daemon

### Changed
- Previous behavior: daemon only uploaded to platform on shutdown
- New behavior: uploads every N cycles AND on shutdown (final state always synced)

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Multi-layer SaaS connection detection** via new `saas_detector.py`
  - Layer 1: env var key patterns, Python import analysis, `.env` file scanning
  - Layer 2: live network connections with per-agent process/framework attribution
  - Layer 4: open sockets, browser history, desktop apps, VSCode extensions
  - Detects 20+ SaaS integrations including Salesforce, Slack, GitHub, AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenAI, Anthropic, Snowflake, Databricks and more
- `saas_connections` and `risk_flags` added to `AgentInventoryItem` — flows into `agent_inventory.json`
- Confidence scoring per SaaS: `confirmed` / `high` / `medium` / `low`
- GHOST agents now show confirmed SaaS connections from live Layer 2 observed connections
- `hostname`, `username`, `os` added to platform upload payload for cross-machine correlation
- Large path warning when scan root contains 500+ Python files
- Progress indicator during correlation step (eliminates apparent hang)

### Changed
- SaaS detection uses exclusive per-agent attribution — machine-wide signals are only attributed to agents with matching process name or framework
- `active_connection` (process/framework matched) distinguished from `active_connection_unmatched`
- GHOST agents skip static analysis (no source code = no env var or import scanning)
- `.env` file search walks up to 4 directory levels to find project root

### Fixed
- Scanner no longer appears to hang during correlation on large codebases
- SaaS detections no longer bleed across all agents indiscriminately

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Platform integration** via `--platform` flag on `scan-all`
  - Uploads scan results to DefendAI platform via `/scanner/ingest`
  - Sends full agent inventory including framework, confidence, metadata
  - Includes `saas_connections` payload with blast radius signals
  - macOS certificate trust handled automatically via `certifi`
- Scanner context (hostname, OS, scanner version) included in platform uploads
- Noise filtering: test fixtures, scanner self-references, node_modules filtered before upload
- `saas_connections` payload: `has_database_access`, `has_cloud_provider`, `has_llm_provider`, `has_external_api_calls`
- Zero new dependencies for SaaS detection — stdlib only (`os`, `ast`)

---

## [2.1.7] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Demo environment with sample agents (CrewAI, Lan, AutoGen, Direct HTTP)
- Demo pods use stdlib `urllib` — no pip install delay at startup
- Systemd service file for daemon mode deployment
- TracingPolicy auto-install for Tetragon

### Changed
- Layer 3 now uses Tetragon native file export instead of kubectl log tailing
- `scan-all` runs layers in parallel for faster completion
- Daemon mode adds retry/backoff, log rotation, disk monitoring

### Fixed
- Layer 3 parser correctly extracts pod info from `process_tracepoint` events
- Layer 3 findings written to output directory when using `--layer3-file`
- Demo pods use ConfigMap for agent scripts
- Tetragon `select`-based polling replaces busy-wait loop
- TracingPolicy filter `state=1` (ESTABLISHED) — fixes nil saddr/daddr at socket init
